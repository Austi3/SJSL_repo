Using percentile percentages oonly heavily favors the higher entrant higher pt vlaue events because lower placements get pretty damn solid total chunks of pts and 
doesnt affect their total overall ratio whereas botb is smaller therefore lower placements will matter more it seems and for 
less total pts but for a greater overall chunk

usign the stacked perscentile threshold where i say oh u get pts if u placed low but still well at a stacked event
DOES matter and seems to impact aryueh and hoodini decently



i think the one where its combined does make the msot sense and gives a fiarly good graphj


WHOAAAAA A9 takes a nosedive iththis ratio prob cuz he entered so much and was incosistent??? wow its a real nosedive tho
it might be tough cuz the more u enter the more points u stand to lose so ok this is NOT THE BEST METRIC HERE!!!

its interesting but like idk

i should look into A9 data make sure thats right lol pritnign or writign to a file would be nice

but i think MY TOURNEY AWARDING POITNS ALGORITHM MIGHT BE FLAWED AND WAAAAAY TOO SKEWED TO THE TOP-- meaning its too harsh
should use A9 as an example by putting breakoint and seeing what he gets and comparing to braacket.com placements

actually.. it seems fairly accurate. based on his average placement percentile hes a solid 60%
